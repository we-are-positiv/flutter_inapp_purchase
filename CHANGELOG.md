## 6.0.0

### Major Release - Open IAP Specification Compliance

This major release redesigns the API to fully comply with the [Open IAP](https://www.openiap.dev) specification, providing a standardized interface for in-app purchases across platforms.

### What is Open IAP?

[Open IAP](https://www.openiap.dev) is an open standard for implementing in-app purchases consistently across different platforms and frameworks. By following this specification, flutter_inapp_purchase now offers:

- Consistent API design patterns
- Standardized error codes and handling
- Unified purchase flow across iOS and Android
- Better interoperability with other IAP libraries

### Breaking Changes

- **Architecture**: Complete redesign following Open IAP specification
  - Removed `useIap` hook and `IapProvider` - use `FlutterInappPurchase.instance` directly
  - Removed `flutter_hooks` dependency
  - Simplified API with direct instance access pattern
- **iOS**: Now requires iOS 11.0+ with StoreKit 2 support (iOS 15.0+)
- **Android**: Updated to Billing Client v8.0.0
- **API Changes**:
  - Enum naming convention: `E_UNKNOWN` → `eUnknown` (lowerCamelCase)
  - Channel access: `FlutterInappPurchase.channel` → `FlutterInappPurchase.instance.channel`
  - Unified error handling with standardized error codes

### New Features

- **Open IAP Compliance**: Full implementation of the Open IAP specification
- **Improved Error Handling**: Standardized error codes across platforms
- **Event-based Architecture**: New listeners for purchase updates and errors
- **StoreKit 2 Support**: Automatic transaction verification on iOS 15.0+
- **Better Type Safety**: Enhanced TypeScript-like type definitions

### Migration Guide

```dart
// Before (5.x)
final iap = useIap();
await iap.initialize();

// After (6.0)
final iap = FlutterInappPurchase.instance;
await iap.initConnection();
```

For complete migration details, see the [documentation](https://flutter-inapp-purchase.hyo.dev).

**Full Changelog**: <https://github.com/hyochan/flutter_inapp_purchase/compare/5.2.0...5.3.0>

## 5.2.0

Bugfix #356

## 5.1.1

Run on UiThread and few others (#328)

- Related #272

- The main difference is a new MethodResultWrapper class that wraps both the result and the channel. onMethodCall() now immediately saves this wrapped result-channel to a field and only uses that later to set both the result and to send back info on the channel. I did this in both Google and Amazon but I can't test the Amazon one.

- Included the plugin registration differences.

- Midified suggested in one of the issues that initConnection, endConnection and consumeAllItems shouldn't be accessors. This is very much so, property accessors are not supposed to do work and have side effects, just return a value. Now three new functions are suggested and marked the old ones deprecated.

Fourth, EnumUtil.getValueString() is not really necessary, we have describeEnum() in the Flutter engine just for this purpose.
